As a self-hosted solution, it enables developers to experiment with LLMs, manage and version prompts, securely manage API keys, and provide safeguards against prompt injection and jailbreak attempts. It also includes built-in OpenTelemetry-native observability and evaluation for the complete GenAI stack (LLMs, Agents, vector databases, and GPUs).\n",

So do not suggest incomplete code which requires users to modify.

If the error can't be fixed or if the task is not solved even after the code is executed successfully, analyze the problem, revisit your assumption, collect additional info you need, and think of a different approach to try.\\nWhen you find an answer, verify the answer carefully.
